# TrustMonitor Content Rules

**Mission:** Make CTOs feel financial pain, then offer the only solution with real liability.

**Tone:** Cold. Institutional. Legal-document precision. Zero warmth. Zero hype.

---

## Core Principles

### 1. Specific Numbers, Not Abstract Claims

❌ **WRONG:** "Significant downtime impact"
✅ **RIGHT:** "$43,000 lost in 22 minutes"

❌ **WRONG:** "Industry-leading uptime"
✅ **RIGHT:** "99.95% uptime with $500 payout per miss"

❌ **WRONG:** "Fast response times"
✅ **RIGHT:** "7 business days for payout"

### 2. Legal Language, Not Marketing Speak

Use actual contract clauses. Quote competitors' SLAs verbatim.

✅ **GOOD:**
> "In no event shall Datadog be liable for lost profits or business opportunities."
> — Datadog SLA, Section 4.2

❌ **BAD:**
> "Most monitoring tools don't cover losses."

### 3. State Facts, Not Opinions

❌ **WRONG:** "We believe monitoring should be better"
✅ **RIGHT:** "Every competitor limits liability to $0"

❌ **WRONG:** "The industry standard is broken"
✅ **RIGHT:** "Datadog paid $47 in service credits. You lost $43,000."

## Forbidden Words & Phrases

### Never Use:

❌ "Join the revolution"
❌ "Game-changing solution"
❌ "Get started"
❌ "We're excited to announce"
❌ "Cutting-edge technology"
❌ "Seamless experience"
❌ "World-class support"
❌ "Trusted by thousands"

### Use Instead:

✅ "Apply for founding program"
✅ "Submit application"
✅ "Review SLA terms"
✅ "Calculate exposure"
✅ "Verify evidence"
✅ "Assess risk"

## Section-by-Section Guidelines

### Hero

**Goal:** Make them relive their worst monitoring failure.

**Rules:**
- Specific timestamp: "February 10, 2026 — 2:47 AM"
- Specific incident: "Payment Gateway Down for 22 Minutes"
- Specific loss: "$43,000 in transactions"
- End with "$0 liability" punch

**Forbidden:**
- Abstract pain points
- Generic "we understand your struggles"
- Friendly/empathetic tone

### Pain Section

**Goal:** Expose their current vendor's actual contract.

**Rules:**
- Quote exact SLA clauses (verbatim, with citations)
- Show specific payout amounts they received
- Compare to actual losses
- Use red for $0 payouts

**Example:**
```
Their SLA Says:
"PagerDuty's total liability shall not exceed fees paid in the prior 12 months."

What You Got:
Maximum payout: $240 (12 months × $20/mo)

What You Lost:
$68,000
```

### Calculator

**Goal:** Make them see THEIR number.

**Rules:**
- Default to realistic values (3 incidents, $15K avg loss)
- Show calculations transparently
- Cap payouts per tier (don't over-promise)
- Use monospace for dollar amounts

**Forbidden:**
- Hiding the math
- Showing unlimited liability
- Emotional language ("imagine saving...")

### Proof Section

**Goal:** Show verification method, not "trust us."

**Rules:**
- Explain technical implementation
- Link to actual verification tools (OpenTimestamps)
- Show sample evidence bundle (real JSON)
- Use monospace for code/data

**Forbidden:**
- "State-of-the-art verification"
- "Military-grade encryption"
- Abstract security claims

### Comparison Table

**Goal:** Direct comparison with real vendors.

**Rules:**
- Name competitors explicitly (Datadog, PagerDuty, Better Uptime)
- State facts only (no trash talk)
- Show TrustMonitor row last (after they've seen alternatives)
- Highlight TrustMonitor row subtly (border color, no "BEST" badge)

**Forbidden:**
- "Unlike other vendors..."
- Negative language about competitors
- Exaggerating differences

### Pricing (Guarantee)

**Goal:** Show this is real money, not vaporware.

**Rules:**
- Show exact dollar amounts
- State liability caps clearly
- Mention founding discount with expiration date
- Use "MOST SELECTED" badge for Professional tier

**Forbidden:**
- "Starting at just..."
- "Affordable pricing"
- Hiding caps or limitations

### Decision Section

**Goal:** Force the binary choice.

**Rules:**
- Two cards: Status quo vs. TrustMonitor
- List specific consequences (not benefits)
- Use ⚠ for status quo risks
- Use ✓ for TrustMonitor outcomes

**Forbidden:**
- "Make the right choice"
- "Don't miss out"
- Urgency tactics beyond founding slots

### Waitlist Form

**Goal:** Qualify leads, not capture everyone.

**Rules:**
- Ask for business metrics (revenue, incidents, losses)
- Require corporate email
- Label optional fields clearly
- State qualification criteria upfront

**Forbidden:**
- "Get instant access"
- "No credit card required"
- Over-promising response times

## Disclaimers & Legal

### Required Disclaimers

**Pre-launch notice:**
> TrustMonitor is a pre-launch product. This site validates founding customer interest. No monitoring services are currently operational.

**Founding slots scarcity:**
> 25 founding slots remaining (update manually as applications come in)

**Payout caps:**

### Placement

## Voice & Tone Examples

### ✅ CORRECT TONE:

> February 10, 2026 — 2:47 AM
> 
> Your payment gateway was down for 22 minutes. Your monitoring tool didn't alert you. You lost $43,000 in transactions.
> 
> Their liability? $0.

**Why it works:**
- Specific timestamp
- Specific loss
- No emotion, just facts
- Ends with brutal truth

### ❌ WRONG TONE:

> Imagine losing thousands because your monitoring failed you. Don't let this happen again! We're revolutionizing uptime monitoring with cutting-edge AI and game-changing liability.

**Why it fails:**
- Abstract loss ("thousands")
- Marketing hyperbole
- Exclamation marks
- Buzzwords (AI, game-changing)

---

## Urgency Tactics

### ✅ ALLOWED:

- Founding slots remaining (25 → 20 → 15, etc.)
- Founding discount expiration date (March 31, 2026)
- "Manual review within 48 hours"

### ❌ FORBIDDEN:

- "Only 3 spots left!"
- "This offer expires tonight!"
- Countdown timers
- "Don't miss out"
- False scarcity

## CTAs (Call-to-Action)

### Button Text Rules

## A/B Testing Guidelines

If testing copy variations:

1. **Hero Headlines** — Test specific incident details
2. **Calculator Defaults** — Test incident count (3 vs 5)
3. **Pricing Order** — Test Standard-first vs Professional-first
4. **Form Length** — Test 5 vs 8 required fields

**DO NOT TEST:**
- Color schemes (locked)
- Tone (institutional, locked)
- Competitor names (factual, locked)

---

### Monthly:
- Verify dollar amounts in examples
- Update "current date" references
- Review form submission data

### Quarterly:
- Re-quote competitor SLAs
- Update founding discount if needed
- Review qualification criteria
