# TrustMonitor Content Rules

**Mission:** Every word must communicate credibility, transparency, and institutional seriousness.

**Target Reader:** A CTO who has been burned by vendor liability clauses and is reading this at 11 PM on a Sunday after another missed alert.

---

## ✍️ CORE PRINCIPLES

### 1. Specificity Over Abstraction

**ALWAYS:**
- Use exact numbers ($43,000, not "significant loss")
- Use exact dates (February 10, 2026 at 2:47 AM)
- Use exact product names (Datadog, PagerDuty, Better Uptime)
- Use exact contract language ("We are not liable for missed alerts")

**NEVER:**
- "Substantial revenue impact"
- "Recently"
- "Leading monitoring tools"
- "Industry-standard terms and conditions"

---

### 2. Facts Over Marketing Claims

**ALWAYS:**
- Quote actual SLA clauses from competitors
- State measurable capabilities (3+ regions, 2/3 quorum, 7yr retention)
- Show real examples (JSON evidence bundle, OpenTimestamps link)
- Acknowledge limitations ($200-$1,000 cap, not unlimited liability)

**NEVER:**
- "Revolutionary approach"
- "Game-changing solution"
- "Unlike anything else"
- "The future of monitoring"

---

### 3. Legal Precision Over Casual Tone

**ALWAYS:**
- Write like a contract, not a blog post
- Use formal language ("pursuant to", "verified outage", "financial compensation")
- Include disclaimers prominently
- State conditions explicitly ("within 24 hours of verification")

**NEVER:**
- "Hey there!"
- "We're excited to announce..."
- "Join us on this journey"
- Exclamation marks in headlines

---

### 4. Pain Amplification Before Solution

**ALWAYS:**
- Start with their current pain (the $0 liability clause)
- Make them relive a specific incident
- Show exactly what they lost vs. what vendor paid
- Only then introduce TrustMonitor as alternative

**NEVER:**
- Lead with TrustMonitor features
- Hide competitor comparisons
- Soften the pain with "but it's okay"
- Skip the emotional punch
